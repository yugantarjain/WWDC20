# Mock Stock, for Planet Earth
Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge winning project programmed on swift playgrounds as an interactive live-view scene for Xcode 11. 

### About the project
The project has been built upon many different disciplines including astrononmy, finance, environment, mathematics, and software development to propagate the environmental cause in the form of a mock-stock.
The project involves mock trading of shares of Earth, Mars, Moon and Kepler 452-b exoplanet through a storyline based on the facts and projections of thousands of years to give an outlook of what the future holds for the world.

Experiencing this shall help in getting a basic understanding about stock trading, knowledge about a few astronomical facts, and of-course awareness about the environment.
